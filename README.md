# Genomics_Project

For this project I wanted to work with large scale human genomic data. In recent years companies like 23andMe and Ancestry have been able to offer the public relatively cheap insights into the secrets that their DNA holds. We have seen applications extend far beyond what we thought imaginable just a decade ago and this has been in part due to the ways in which both DNA sequencing and analysis have transformed the industry in tandem.
